# CÃ³isir - A Group Collaboration Application Built Using Ionic 3

## Installation and Configuration

### The following instructions are for launching the application in a web browser only, as the app currently doesn't function correctly when running on a mobile device.

In order to run this application in a  web browser, the following components must be installed. 

* Node.js
* Ionic 3

Node.js can be downloaded [here](http://nodejs.org/), select a version to download and install it. When Node.js is installed, Ionic can be installed using the following command

`$ npm install -g ionic`

Once Ionic is installed, the git repository can be then cloned onto your PC to a directory of your choosing. Once this is complete, perform a `cd` command into the directory where you cloned the repository and run the command

`$ ionic serve`, in order to run the application in your browser.
